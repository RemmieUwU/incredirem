<h1>Why I’m Rebuilding Incredirem.com with HTML</h1>
Hey everyone! I used to use fancy, expensive tools to build and manage my site, <b>"incredirem.com"</b>, but I wanted more control and a simpler approach. So, I’m going back to basics and rebuilding my site using just HTML.
<br><br>
Why? Well, those high-end tools were cool, but they were a bit too complex and pricey. By going back to HTML, I can tweak every little detail myself and make the site exactly how I want it. It’s a great way to learn more about web development and keep things flexible.
<br><br>
Plus, it’s a fun challenge! I’m excited to have full control and make "incredirem.com" truly my own. Stay tuned for the revamped site, can’t wait to show you what I’ve got planned!
